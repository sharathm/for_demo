This file was created as part of a initial commit to demonstrate git capabilities.
The specific topic covered here is conflicts.

Now of course there can be commits done on master branch, while there are changes in the other branch. 

Basically what i wanted to show was that if there are merge conflicts between merges, how can they be resolved and then the repository made clean.
